# Additional Practice

Take a moment to celebrate the fact that you've made it through the Prework —
congratulations! You should now be in great shape to start the program!

Shown below are some suggestions for additional practice if you have extra time
— or at any time while you're completing the program. They are based on feedback
from past students about the topics and skills they felt they could have used
more practice with beyond what is covered in the curriculum.

Any time you can devote to the resources and suggestions below will pay off not
only as you continue through the curriculum, but also as you prepare to
interview for jobs and, ultimately, begin your career as a developer.

**Top Tip**: We've provided a lot of information here, but you shouldn't stress
too much about it! Don't feel you need to get through everything — some of the
resources will work well for you and some won't. Anything you're able to
accomplish — even if it's a small amount — will help!

## Code Code Code!

The best way to learn to code is by doing it — a lot! Repetition and practice
will help your brain process the concepts you're learning, and will build muscle
memory for things you will do again and again as a coder. Repetition and
practice actually create [physical changes in the brain][physical-changes] that
will make you a faster and more efficient coder.

Some specific suggestions:

1. Go back and review some of the JavaScript lessons and labs in the Prework.
   Topics of particular importance include: functions, arguments and parameters,
   control flow (conditional statements), loops/iteration, and data structures.

2. As you're practicing a concept (or learning it for the first time!), come up
   with your own examples and code them out. Although reading through the
   provided examples and following along are important, using a technique in a
   different way will help you understand it better and internalize the
   concepts.

3. Get started with code challenges. This will both give you practice coding
   _and_ begin to prepare you for job interviews. There are [lots of online
   resources][best-code-challenge-sites], and most have a free membership level.

**Top Tip**: Note that, while practice is very important, _taking breaks is just
as important_! Research on learning shows that your brain needs downtime to
effectively process and absorb what you've learned.

## Get Comfortable with the Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI will be one of the most valuable tools you use as a developer, but it
takes time and practice to get comfortable with it. Here are some good resources
to help you up your skills:

- [The 50 Most Popular Linux & Terminal Commands - Full Course for
  Beginners][linux-commands-course]. This free 5-hour course, offered by [Free
  Code Camp][free-code-camp], provides an excellent beginner-friendly
  introduction to the commands you will use most often as a developer.
- [Linux Commands Handbook][linux-commands-handbook] is the handbook that the
  course above is based on. You can download a PDF if you sign up for the
  author's newsletter.
- Cheatsheets:
  - Beginner friendly:
    [https://linuxconfig.org/linux-commands-cheat-sheet](https://linuxconfig.org/linux-commands-cheat-sheet)
  - More comprehensive:
    [https://learncodethehardway.org/unix/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf](https://learncodethehardway.org/unix/bash_cheat_sheet.pdf)
  - Downloadable:
    [https://garywoodfine.com/linux-terminal-command-cheat-sheets](https://garywoodfine.com/linux-terminal-command-cheat-sheets/)
    (includes an Ubuntu-specific version)
- [Command Line Mystery][command-line-mystery] is a fun way to practice CLI
  commands — and solve a mystery while you're at it!

**Top Tip**: Remember, the idea here is **not** to memorize scores of CLI
commands! Instead, the goals are to:

1. Build your comfort level with using the command line,
2. Develop a feel for the range of tasks you can perform, and
3. Learn how to use the resources available to you to find the command you need
   and how to use it.

## Build your Skills with Git and GitHub

Git and GitHub are two other invaluable tools for developers. As with using the
CLI, you will build your Git and GitHub skills and comfort level over time, but
if you can start the process early, it will pay off in the long run.

The following resources will help solidify your understanding of what Git and
GitHub are and the needs they meet, and give you more practice with the basic
Git/GitHub workflow you've already learned. They will also introduce you to some
of the more advanced Git workflows that you will use all the time — perhaps
daily! — when you're working as a developer.

- [Git Immersion][git-immersion]: hands-on exercises that will give you practice
  with the basic Git commands and workflow
- [Git Parable][git-parable] provides a story-based explanation of the reasoning
  behind Git features
- [Beginner's Guide to GitHub][beginners-guide] provides a beginner-friendly
  overview of how to use GitHub
- [Interactive Git Cheatsheet][git-cheatsheet]

**Top Tip**: Again, you shouldn't worry about memorizing commands here, or
stress if you don't fully understand all of Git's capabilities. The important
thing is to develop a high-level understanding of Git and GitHub, and to
practice the basic workflow. You'll get more comfortable the more you use it,
and you'll learn its more advanced capabilities over time.

## Conclusion

There is no wrong way to approach the material in this lesson. Work through some
of it now if you can, but you can also come back to it whenever you have some
extra time, or if you just need a break from lessons and labs. Getting some
additional practice using these resources (or others you find on your own) will
give you a boost towards your goal of becoming a developer.
